# {{ metadata.project.title }}

This project contains a self-contained automated system for setting up and
managing {{ metadata.project.subject }}.

It is based on [gridlinker](https://github.com/wellbehavedsoftware/gridlinker),
which provides tools to manage data and a collection of general purpose
playbooks. It uses [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) to store runtime data,
and [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to perform deployments.
