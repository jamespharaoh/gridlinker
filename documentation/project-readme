This project contains a self-contained automated system for setting up and
managing {{ metadata.project.subject }}.

It is based on [gridlinker](https://github.com/wellbehavedsoftware/gridlinker),
which provides tools to manage data and a collection of general purpose
playbooks. It uses [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) to store runtime data,
and [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to perform deployments.

This documentation is generated automatically, so please do not modify it
directly, or your changes will be overwritten.

## Requirements

This project depends on a recent version of python, currently 2.7.10. You can
download the [source code](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and compile this
yourself.

You will also need to download and install
[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), and a number of packages:

* jinja2
* netaddr
* paramiko
* pyopenssl
* pyyaml

## Configuration

Most users will be provided with a copy of this software along with the relevant
configuration. If this is the case, you should be able to run commands directly,
and discover options via the built-in help.

```sh
cd {{ metadata.project.name }}
./{{ metadata.project.script }} --help
```

To set up a connection to an existing database, create `config/connections.yml`,
using the following template:

```yaml
---

{{ metadata.project.name }}:

  etcd_servers: [ "{{ metadata.etcd.default_servers | join ('", "') }}" ]
  etcd_secure: "{{ metadata.etcd.default_secure }}"
  etcd_prefix: "{{ metadata.etcd.default_prefix }}"

# ex: et ts=2 filetype=yaml
```

You also need to obtain a valid certificate, along with its private key, and the
ca certificate, from the administrator. These should be placed in the following
places:

* `config/{{ metadata.project.name }}-ca.cert`
* `config/{{ metadata.project.name }}.cert`
* `config/{{ metadata.project.name }}.key`

To use a local etcd server, for example during development or testing or when
you are working online, use the following configuration:

```yaml
---

{{ metadata.project.name }}:

  etcd_servers: [ "localhost" ]
  etcd_secure: "no"
  etcd_prefix: "{{ metadata.etcd.default_prefix }}"

# ex: et ts=2 filetype=yaml
```

<div style="display:none">
<!-- ex: noet ts=4 filetype=markdown -->
</div>
