Short-title: Package distribution
Long-title: Wistla package distribution
Description: Wistla's private repository for package distribution

Wistla uses a lot of third party code, and we also distribute our own code, for
example builds of the client apps. All of this is hosted on our own system,
which drastically reduces the frequency of build problems caused by errors or
downtime of third-party systems.

This is implemented as an AWS S3 bucket, with a cloudfront distribution in front
of it. The cloudfront distribution is required, because S3 does not support
HTTPs natively, which is an important requirement. This is hosted in this way,
rather than on our servers, since this means that it could be used to rebuild
our servers if they weren't available.

## Accessing the repository

The repository is available on the following URL:

* https://dist.ops.wistla.com/

This should show a 403, since directory listing is not permitted! All of the
objects in the S3 bucket, however, should be available on the appropriate path.

## Uploading packages to the distribution

Uploading packages is as simple as logging into the AWS console, switching to
the `ops` account, accessing the S3 service, selecting the `dist.ops.wistla.com`
bucket, and uploading the relevant files.

Please note that there are properties which can be used to affect the caching of
these items. By default the caching is set to, and limited to, 60 seconds,
although previously this was much higher, causing various annoying problems.

## iPhone enterprise builds

**TODO** These are hosted via this service. I do not know the details of this,
can someone please fill in any relevant information when they have a chance?
